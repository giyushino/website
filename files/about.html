    <p class = topic><strong>About the Content:</strong></p>
        <p class = "normal"> I plan on hosting a wide variety of content here (or at least I plan to). More than simply being a research portfolio, I hope this can become a digital archive of mine, one that I can look back on fondly. </p>
        <p class = "normal"> Several months ago, when I was making a personal site (this is like the umpteenth time I tried creating a website), this is how I worded my motivation for doing so: What are humans apart from our memories? Strip them away from us and what do we become? With this site, I hope to keep a record of my thought process, works, and life in general. Even though I have only been in college for a few months, I've come to understand how fast paced life can be, and how fleeting moments are. Without any pictures or written records, I find myself wondering how exactly I felt at certain points my life, or what exactly I did. I feel disapointed by the fact that my truimphs, failures, and thoughts are essentially lost to time due to my negligence.
