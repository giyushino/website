emaciated, we devour until our stomachs bulge; 
grossly full, we abstain until emaciated ribs show. 
we stuff and starve, slaves to the tides of love.
every night, we stand beneath the same stars, 
and yet, every night we kiss beneath a different moon. 
when will we be freed from this gluttonous delicacy?
the ebb and flow may never become static, 
the moon will never stop waning and waxing, 
are we fated to do the same?

my friend, tame thy tempest of thought 
and listen to the heart once again. 
lay down the lance of logic and drink 
no more of the ground gourd!
walk with me where reason is rejected; 
let us speak with sighs and glances sent,
run our mouths and laugh with our bellies.
the reign of rationale runs tight, though
far below thy brow, the heart remains free
    </pre>

there's no need to shout your love, 
whispher it to me softly, my beloved. 
let it seep into me as your fingertips 
run along my skin, let me relish it 
from your laugh, let me observe
it in your twinkling eyes. love
me softly, and i'll listen intently. 
there's no need to shout, for
i am here beside you, my beloved.

    <pre style="text-align: right;">
                                      wait for me

                                      wait until the world falls asleep,
                                      and when not a soul stirs ’cept for yours,
                                      let the walls of your heart fall.
                                      take a step into the garden of the soul,
                                      unfettered by the mind’s shackles.
                                      pluck the wilting rose by the roadside;
                                      wonder not why it smells sharply of iron
                                      and return it. bloodied, continue on
                                      exploring the flora to your heart’s content.
                                      when the world begins to rouse,
                                      spare a moment to find the rose once more.
                                      petals to nose, inhale deeply and laugh;
                                      sweet, floral, fruity, not a trace of metal
                                      can be detected
          </pre>

“more than star stuff”

the calcium in our teeth, the keratin in our nails,
the collagen in our tendons, know naught of 
what makes us human, of what our frail 
lives can grow to become. 

should we listen to our bones, 
we would become lifeless drones, 
returning to our roots as star stuff
ignorant to those around us. 
so why not smile and dance 
during this short, short chance?
